Personal-Assistant
This repository contains a simple program that uses the wolframalpha package to answer user's questions.

Getting Started
To use this program, you'll need to obtain an app id from Wolfram Alpha. Once you have the app id, replace 'Your app_id' in the program with your app id.

Usage
Run the program and you will be prompted to enter a question. The program will use the Wolfram Alpha API to search for an answer and print it out. Type 'exit' to exit the program.

In case of no result found or any other error, an appropriate message will be displayed.

Note
Please note that the free version of the Wolfram Alpha API allows only a limited number of requests per month.
